Categories to Look for Vulnerabilities  
SQL Injection  
Cross Site Scripting (XSS)  
Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)  
Authentication related issues  
Authorization related issues  
Redirection Attacks  
Remote Code Execution  
Data Exposure  
  
>Norms to be followed while researching on vulnerabilities  
Creating large amounts of trial accounts  
Modification of data owned by other users  
Deletion or corruption of data owned by other users  
Denial of service attacks  
Social engineering attacks including phishing  
Email bombing or similar high-volume attacks  
Mass submissions to or scanning of our contact us or support forms  
Please do not violate any laws or agreements in order to locate vulnerabilities.  
  
Vulnerability Categories that are Out of Scope  
Denial of Service (DoS)  
SSL vulnerabilities (i.e. misconfiguration or version)  
Brute force attacks  
User enumeration  
Misconfigured flags on non-sensitive cookies  
Logout CSRF  
Issues only present in deprecated browsers or plugins  
Clickjacking on pages without authentication and/or sensitive state  
changes  
Vulnerabilities that require users to perform highly unlikely actions (i.e.  
disabling browser security features, sending an attacker critical info,  
etc.)  
Email bombing or similar high-volume attacks  
  
Vulnerabilities  
Email Spoofing  
Missing Security Headers (such as the HSTS header), unless the lack of  
such a header directly leads to a vulnerability  
Sessions not expiring on security events, such as password changes  
Clickjacking  
Vulnerabilities that require odd or unlikely user interaction  
Self-XSS  
Logout Cross-Site Request Forgery  
Missing Rate Limiting  
Weak Password Policy  
EXIF Data Not Stripped on Images  
Host header injection, unless an exploit is demonstrated (such as cache  
-poisoning or XSS)  
  
LINUX AND ADMINISTRATION FUNDAMENTALS   
What is the root user?  
The power of the root user  
Basic concept of security groups and users  
Experience using a Linux terminal emulator  
Fundamental networking concepts  
Fundamental understanding of interpreted programming languages (Perl, Python, Ruby)  
Networking protocols such as HTTP, LDAP, FTP, IMAP, SMTP  
Cores that compose a computer operating system: file system, drivers, and the kerne  
COMMANDS  
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/linux_admin/basic_centos_linux_commands.htm  
Basic Commands every Linux Administrator should be proficient in are −  
Vim, grep, more and less, tail, head, wc, sort, uniq, tee, cat, cut, sed, tr, paste  
In the Linux world, Administrators use filtering commands every day to parse logs, filter command output, and perform actions with interactive shell scripts. As mentioned, the power of these commands come in their ability to modify one another through a process called piping.

What is System Design:
System design the process of designing a system(any software application). So while we start designing any software system few things we keep in mind.
    What all features application will have.
    How many users will access this.
    At a time how many requests will come to the application.
    How much we want to scale more our application and what is the allowed cost for that.

High-Level Design:
what are Load balancers, Caching, Compute Power, SQL vs NoSQL, Streaming, Data Modeling, etc. Few important topics are like
    Design Twitter
    Design Prime Music
    Design Google Drive
    Design Uber
    Design Netflix
    Design Instagram

Low-Level Design:
design a basic crud operation of any system and then writes code for that with test cases and deployment.
checks your DSA knowledge as well as OOPs knowledge. Suppose in the given problem like(Create a note taking app) interviewer will ask questions like how you will organize data, how to fetch data, which data structure to use and why, test cases, UML, ER Diagram, etc.
